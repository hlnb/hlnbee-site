## Welcome to my digital sanctuary …

a haven where I explore the road less traveled, unravel the complexities of my journey, and find solace in the transformative power of web technologies. As a multifaceted individual, I wear multiple hats: I am a veteran, a devoted mother and doting nana, a master knitter, and a website designer/developer. Above all, I am a seeker of meaning, drawing inspiration from great thinkers like Adler and the Stoics. Join me as we unveil the transformative power of the Internet, one step at a time.

### Unveiling a Journey:

My career path has been as diverse as it has been enlightening. Serving in the RAAF, I navigated the complexities of military life while finding solace in teaching and technology. From the challenges of loading telex machines to deciphering the enigma of the infamous ration pack, I thrived on problem-solving and illuminating the path forward for those around me.

### A Turning Point:

The year 2000 marked a pivotal moment in my life. I bid farewell to the RAAF and embarked on a 14-year journey in vocational education, specializing in web design and development. It was a chapter dedicated to finding healing and meaning, as I guided eager learners with meticulous precision, witnessing their growth and evolution.

### The Quest for Healing and Discovery:

In 2015, I took another transformative step, intertwining the wisdom of Adler and the Stoics into my personal odyssey of healing and self-discovery. Through Codemaster Institute bootcamps, I found a platform to inspire and empower aspiring web enthusiasts, igniting their passion for the digital realm.

### Unlocking a World of Possibilities:

Today, my commitment to education and personal growth is stronger than ever. I venture into the digital frontier to empower individuals like you with the skills and knowledge to thrive in the vast landscape of web technologies. Through every thread I knit and website I develop, I showcase the transformative power of web technologies.

### Conclusion

So, join me in my digital sanctuary to find solace, unleash creativity, and embark on your own journey of healing and self-discovery. Let's explore the endless possibilities together and expand our horizons. Whether you're a beginner, an experienced developer, or simply seeking inspiration, this sanctuary is a place for learning, growth, and the pursuit of a life less ordinary.
