					<h2>Unveiling a Journey:</h2>
					<p>
						My career path has been as diverse as it has been enlightening.
						Serving in the RAAF, I navigated the complexities of military life
						while finding solace in teaching and technology. From the challenges
						of loading telex machines to deciphering the enigma of the infamous
						ration pack, I thrived on problem-solving and illuminating the path
						forward for those around me.

						The year 2000 marked a pivotal moment in my life. I bid farewell to
						the RAAF and embarked on a 14-year journey in vocational education,
						specializing in web design and development. It was a chapter
						dedicated to finding healing and meaning, as I guided eager learners
						with meticulous precision, witnessing their growth and evolution.

					<h2>The Quest for Healing and Discovery:</h2>
					<p>
						In 2015, I took another transformative step, intertwining the wisdom
						of Adler and the Stoics into my personal odyssey of healing and
						self-discovery. Through Codemaster Institute bootcamps, I found a
						platform to inspire and empower aspiring web enthusiasts, igniting
						their passion for the digital realm.
